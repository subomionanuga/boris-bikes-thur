# Boris Bike Challanges

## Goals
Mindful engagement with these challenges can help you achieve these goals:

* I write code that is easy to change
Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.

* I can test-drive my code
Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.

* I can build with objects
Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.

* I know how my language works
Understanding your language is important because it helps you reason and communicate about software effectively. This makes your teams more effective, and most software is made by teams.
